# More Guidelines:

To practice hacking: the platforms is "Hack The Box" / "Try Hack me". Check it out!

And as we know there are a lot of websites on the internet. Your job will be to protect them! A good thing
to do next is to take some Bug Bounty course that will teach advance topics like SQL injection, XSS ,
CSRF ... in more details! Once you feel more comfortable with discovering Bugs in Web Apps, you can
take a look at platform called "BugCrowd" !

### Exploit Development:

This is arguably the hardest thing to learn as an ethical hacker. This requires years of learning and
practice and there are multiple things you need to learn for this one. Firstly Exploit Developer is a
person that finds "Zero Day" exploits and develops a code to exploit a zero day vulnerability. However
this puts you far ahead of others as you have the knowledge to find exploits yourself.

You don't have to wait for a certain tool to come out or for someone else to create the exploit.
You do it yourself.

For this knowledge of Networking is needed. Deep Knowledge of Operating Systems is also needed.
And of course a really good programming knowledge is needed! You will most likely need to learn Assembly
language (low level language) which isn't easy to learn, but if you do it you are already half way done.
Once you learn assembly you can dive into different debuggers and all of this knowledge combined can help
you achieve a title of an Exploit Developer! Good Luck!
