# Vulnerability Analysis

Vulnerability Analysis, in the context of cybersecurity, is the process of identifying, quantifying,
and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system.
It involves the systematic examination of systems or software to determine the adequacy of security
measures, identify security deficiencies, provide data from which to predict the effectiveness of
proposed security measures, and confirm the adequacy of such measures after implementation.

## Vulnerability Analysis tools

### nmap scripts

- [documentation](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html)
- cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts : to see the list of scripts
- nmap --script [script-name] [target] -sS : eg. nmap --script auth 192.168.1.6 -sS
- nmap --script malware 192.168.1.6 -sS : to check for if the target machine contains malware
- nmap --script banner 192.168.1.6 -sS : to check for the banner of the target machine
- nmap --script exploit 192.168.1.6 -sS : to check for the exploits of the target machine
- nmap --script-help [script-name] : to see the about the script

### manual vulnerability analysis

- google -> [name of the open port with version] exploit : to find the exploit for the open port on google search
- searchsploit [name of the open port with version] : to find the exploit for the open port on the local machine
- locate [exploit-path] : to get whole path of the exploit
- cd to it
- nano [exploit-name] : to see the exploit code

### Nessus

- download nessus (essential) from google
- sudo dpkg -i [file-path] : to install the nessus
- sudo /etc/init.d/nessusd start : to start the nessus
- open browser and go to https://kali:8834 to configure the nessus
- start basic network scan using the nessus website
