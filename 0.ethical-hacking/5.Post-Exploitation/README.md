# POST EXPLOITATION

Post-exploitation refers to the phase of a cyber attack that occurs after an attacker has successfully
compromised a target system. It involves the attacker gaining further access, maintaining control, and
extracting valuable information from the compromised system. This phase typically involves activities
such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and persistence.
