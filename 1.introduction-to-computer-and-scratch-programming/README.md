## `Mid 1` [Project Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/669573193)

1. A cyclist will go from right to left while riding a bicycle. When he moves to the left again, his entry will be from the right again. It will continue like this.
2. Then you will see a man walking. There is no costume change or movement of the wheel on the bicycle. There are four types of image or costume changes during the movement of a person who is walking from left to right. When he moves from left to right, he will start again from the left. If you press the up arrow, the person who is walking will go up a little and his size will become a little smaller. If you click down arrow again, it will go down and its size will be a little bigger.
3. The third sprite is that a car will go from right to left and then flip to the next line from left to right again and its size will be a little bigger. In this way he will change direction again from left to right and then his size will be a little smaller
4. Pressing the space key will play a music and pressing the M key will stop the music

## `Final Exam`

`Short Questions: [5 marks each]`

1. What are the tasks that the Operating System performs as “Resource Manager”?
2. What do you think would be the case if search engines like Google did not exist?
3. Suppose you want to search for apartments to rent. The apartments must be in Dhaka, but you want to avoid Mirpur. What text do you type in the search box?’
4. There are three basic logical structures in programming – sequence, selection and repetition. Differentiate between selection and repetition.

`Animation: [30 marks]`

1. Initially, a lion stands on a trampoline.
2. It jumps and rotates at the same time
3. Completing the jump, the lion lands back on the trampoline.
4. The lion keeps doing the above sequence of movements.
5. If the mouse is taken on the lion and clicked, the animation stops.

`Game: Build a car racing [50 marks]`

1. First draw the background using backdrops editor. Play around to see how you can draw rectangles/blocks of different colors and join them to make an image like above.
   The blue block is our car’s starting point and the red block is the finish line.
2. Upload the image of the orange car as a sprite. Your player will drive this car using the arrow keys.
3. The black area is the road. The car is only allowed to go through the road. If it hits the green field, the game is over and the player loses. If the player can avoid hitting green regions and reaches the red line, he/she will win. In scratch, you may use touching color? block from the Sensing menu to check this.
4. The car has a speed value, initially set to 1. The player can increase or decrease the speed, but cannot have negative speed.
5. The car continuously moves along its natural direction at the rate of its speed (move \_ steps in Motion).
6. The game controls are as follows:
   Right Arrow Key:Turn a bit right (Rotate clockwise 15 degrees).
   Left Arrow Key:Turn a bit left (Rotate anti-clockwise 15 degrees).
   Up Arrow Key:Increase speed value.
   Down Arrow Key:Decrease speed value.
7. There will be a “Timer:” at the corner of the screen that shows time passed (in seconds). Use the timer variable from sensing and floor function from operators to find the value to be shown.
